# Collaborative Computational Development: Running an NCBI-Style Hackathon
This document provides guidance on how to run an [NCBI-style hackathon](https://f1000research.com/articles/5-672/v2). The original document was developed during the June 2017 hackathon held at the New York Genome Center.  We invite members of the community to make edits and additions by submitting pull requests.

## Objective:
__To provide guidance for collaboratively developing computational biology pipelines through NCBI-style hackathons__
## Our Method:
* Observe groups/projects over time, especially
* How objectives change over time
* The skills / software / processes required
* How groups communicate, interact
