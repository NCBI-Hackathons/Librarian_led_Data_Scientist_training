* Participants will analyze and define the problem they are looking to solve using a computational pipeline
* Participants will design a computational pipeline for processing and/or analyzing a specific type of data or solving a particular problem
* Participants will write a novel pipeline/code to solve a problem using standard computational tools
* Participants will describe the purpose and use of the pipeline they have created in enough detail to be used by others
