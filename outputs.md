# Hackathon Outputs and Documentation 
While the primary goal of a hackathon is to create pipelines and solve computational problems, an important secondary goal is the documentation of the work of the team.  Ideally, teams will develop software that can be adopted by the community and used widely beyond the scope of the hackathon.  In order to make this possible, teams need to think about how to make their new tools available and visible to potential users.  In addition, teams should consider what documentation will be needed to enable others to use their new tool.  This documentation may be as simple a Github README file or as complex as a user manual or tutorial.  Depending on the type of tool and its level of completeness at the end of a hackathon, a variety of outlets may be appropriate to provide this documentation and publicize the tool.

## Github README
It is best practice for every Github repo, whether associated with a hackathon or not, to have a [README file](https://help.github.com/articles/about-readmes/), which is displayed on the front page of the repo.  README files are written in markdown, which can be used to create formatting to make the document attractive and functional.  Those who are less familiar with markdown may find the [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) useful. 

The README file should contain crucial information about the contents of the repo, including what the software does, how to use it, and who maintains it.  In addition to providing the important details a user will need to be able to use the software, the README can be thought of as a brief "advertisement" for the software.  Why is this tool exciting and useful?

## Scholarly Publications
Besides documenting their code, teams may also wish to consider writing a manuscript for submission to a scholarly journal.  Doing so creates a scholarly record of the work of the team, making it possible to cite in future scholarly articles, which allows the team to get academic credit for the work they have completed.  

### The hackathon paper
A hackathon paper typically consists of four parts:

* Introduction: a brief description of the tool, and, more importantly, an explanation of the problem it solves. Why is this problem significant and why does it need a solution?
* Methods: an explanation of how the team set about solving the problem, including software tools and datasets used, and other relevant 
* Results: a discussion of the final outcome of the project.  What worked and what didn't?  Did the final product accomplish what the team set out to do, and if not, where did it fall short?
* Conclusion and next steps: to whom will this new tool be of use and what can they expect to use it for?  Are there plans for further development, either by the team, or things that the team hopes the community will do to help move the tool forward?

A [read-only copy of a template for hackathon papers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14DycE62xpFncUr5hP-D4hBf3AFirJGh0uAgBRjevnt8/edit?usp=sharing) is available via Google docs.  This template was designed for papers intended to be submitted to F1000Research (see below), though it can be adapted for use with other publications.  It includes placeholders and detailed instructions for information that should be included with F1000Research submissions.

### F1000Research and open peer review
F1000Research is an open access journal that hosts a [Hackathons collection](http://f1000research.com/channels/hackathons) containing papers describing papers from previous NCBI and NCBI-style hackathons.  All hackathon teams are welcome to submit papers to the F1000Research Hackathons collection.  F1000Research utilizes an open peer review process; papers are posted shortly after submission and are available online immediately.  Authors are required to submit names of potential peer reviewers, whose reviews are posted publicly on the site.  Authors then have a chance to revise their paper and respond to peer reviewer comments.  Once a paper has received two positive reviews, it will be indexed in MEDLINE for inclusion in PubMed.  Thus it is in the authors' best interest to select reviewers who are likely to respond to the request to review.  Although only two reviews are required, authors are asked to suggest 5-8 reviewers so that the chances of receiving two reviews are increased.
