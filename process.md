# Organizing and setting up the hackathon
```Written by: Peter Oxley```

## Selecting Topics
**By request: Some people will have projects they want to lead**

* Project Description: What need will your project fulfill? What do you want its functionality to be?
* General Project Goals: What do you want the end product to be, and how do you want to get there?
* What are your strengths, and what types of skills might you rely on your team members for? : If you're going to need a proficient programmer in a given language, tell us about it here.
* Please specify any atypical software you may need.
* I anticipate my project will involve more than 3TB of data

**By relevance: How do we define a good problem**
 
 
## Selecting Participants
#### Advertising
Reaching all the relevant people

#### Inviting
* Team lead
* Forms: Data to collect:
    * questions from June Hackathon's form
        * Do you have a working knowledge of shell scripting?
        * Do you use any other programming languages?
        * What is the primary research question you work on?
        * Are you interested in working on a similar problem during this workshop?
        * Please tell us in 3-4 sentences why you want to participate.
        * Here are Some Approximate Project Titles (which are expected to evolve); which are you interested in working on?
        * What is your email address?
        * What is your name?
        * What is your approximate geographic location?
    * Making them machine readable: checkboxes over free text
 
#### Filtering
* Criteria
* Number of participants - factor in a 10% drop-out rate
* Required knowledge - depends on the topic
 
## Creating a schedule
#### Basic elements
**Time** - how long to have a hackathon?

| Option | Pros | Cons |
| The 24 hr model. |  Less up front commitment, since it is over after a day (though need time to recover?) |  Problem with productivity - what are people really doing at 2am? |
| The three day model |  Everyone gets to sleep, focus productivity during day. | Harder to recruit, since participants have to take three days off work, other work builds up. |
|---| Time for socialising and team building |---|
