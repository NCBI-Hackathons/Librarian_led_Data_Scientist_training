# Notes on discussions with project team members

## Teams that have contributed:
**Team 1, [Barcode Partitioning](https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/Barcode_Partitioning)** *Brian, Tuesday morning*
**Team 5, [Shiny app for visualization of protein correlation](https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/Proteomic_Correlation_Shiny)** *Peter, Tuesday lunch*

**What has surprised you?**

>The high quality of skilled team mates. Everybody came from different backgrounds, but they got working together well really quick.

>The diversity of backgrounds present at the event - biologists, physicists, bioinformaticians

>The real life data was an issue - didnâ€™t turn out to be a good benchmark.

>Barely any coding as team lead!


**What unanticipated challenges or problems have come up?**

> Nothing beyond the technical stuff (ie, having to learn some things on the fly).

> The team's project was given to the team by someone who is not on the team or in the hackathon, so that has been challenging in the sense of most of the team members were not coming directly from the problem space of the project.

>Colleague with ```Shiny``` expertise was sick and pulled out last minute.

>Having to give up on details associated with the goals - ensuring consistent formatting, using best practices - these goals quickly break down. This seems typical of hackathon code. Taking time to write a proper function is a time luxury. Code testing is also early to go.
 
>Unanticipated hardware issues (exploding laptop charger) 
 
>This is a good forum to try out new ideas, but needs lots of follow up. Getting an idea of what works or is an utter failure is a great outcome for the hackathon. 


**What have you learned so far?  (Such as any new tools, approaches, etc?)**
> Had to learn the python module `argparse` for creating a command line tool.

>Had to learn about the backend sequencing (how data is created, errors, etc), which is not part of my day to day work.

>How to make an R package just for data.


**How have your plans/goals/approaches changed?  (The approach you are taking to reach your goals?)**
> Not much, has been pretty straight going. The team leader sees that this project can benefit my work, so my guidance has been good.

>The goal was initially vague, but the group then figured out the specifics of what that goal would look like.


**What do you wish you would have known or done when you started out with this project?**
>Nothing much, I came in with an open mind and have found this hackathon experience to be good.


**What tips would you give other hackathon participants?**
>Come in with an open mind, and be prepared to be flexible.
